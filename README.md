# flask-skulpt

Currently, in the 'js' folder, there are two "skulpt.min.js" files:
1. "skulpt-website.min.js" is the js fetched from http://skulpt.org/js/skulpt.min.js 
2. "skulpt-dist.min.js" is the js downloaded from https://github.com/skulpt/skulpt-dist/archive/master.zip

Skulpt from the website compiles and runs the python properly while the one from the repo doesn't.
